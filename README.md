# Project Description

There's a ton that goes into making a great wine (besides grapes that is) and we wanted to delve a bit deeper and get to the bottom of what makes a "great" wine versus an "okay" one. Starting with a dataset full of variables, the California Wine Institute wants us to shed a better light on the determinants of wine quality. Through feature selection, clustering, and classification modeling, we're hoping to accurately predict wine quality.

# Project plan
- Gather Wine Quality csvs from Data.world
- Bring files into python and join the data, seperating by color of wine
- Take initial looks and get a brief understanding of features
- Begin cleaning joined data
- Establish Initial Hypotheses 
- Explore new dataframe and perform feature selection
